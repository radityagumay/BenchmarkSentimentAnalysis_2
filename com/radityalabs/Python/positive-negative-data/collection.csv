my first visit was a few days ago  but never the less  as i remember the soft savory deliciousness of my lamb shank  the couscous raining down my throat and the bouquet of roses that blossomed in my mouth with every sip of my lemonade  i drool im really starting to salivate now and need to push my key board out of drools way   the appetizer portions are for one person strange  i know  so dont go into getting an appetizer thinking youll share with a friend   the neighborhood is quiet and the restaurant is cozy  staff is very pleasant  and i am officially a fan  terrifically tasty tunisian treats for the tummy,positive
i dont know why anyone eats ice cream anymore,positive
im not a vegetarian or vegan  so when this place was recommended to me  i was skeptical i decided to try it  though  and it is so delicious i have been here a bunch recently and i havent had a bad dish  to order here  you choose one of three pizza dough  brown rice  or coconut rice and an entree to go on top they have daily specials which are delicious and soups of the week i just recently had tomato and lentil soup which was delicious  also  it is a small space and is part of a music club  club passim you will be asked upon entering if youre there for the show or for dinner you may have to wait for a table  especially if you have 4 people  and takeout is always a fast  delicious option also  before 4 or 5pm  there are no waiters  so you just place your order through a window to the cook  it is a little hard to find  take a look at the pictures on yelp its a basement and connected to club passim  so if youre going here at night  you may hear music from the club just follow that and youll figure it out  they also have 2 beers on tap and desserts,positive
i just went last week the restaurant gets 5 stars because the staff is excellent friendly  knowledgeable  the food is superb  and the ambiance is great  one warning i went expecting real southern food i went with my mother  from texas  and father  from virginia  and told them it was southern it is not traditional southern  but still delicious my mom and dad both said it was great  just not real southern  i had the catfish  my mom had the chicken  my dad had the pork i loved the catfish  and my parents loved their dishes for desert  we had the peach melba that was the most delicious desert i can remember having if you go  get the melba its seasonal so get it while it lasts,positive
this place is great they have a lot of cocktails  so you can go here plenty of times without having to drink the same drink twice  and they are all great they also have good beer and a pretty big wine list  though ive never had wine here  the food looks amazing  but i havent had dinner here yet i have had the chips and dip  though both the chips and the dip are homemade and so amazingly delicious  i wont look at chips the same way again  sundays are stout  oyster night  where with every stout you get  you also get a free oyster i love sundays here wednesdays are mexicantheme and they have a whole list of cocktails made with tequila they also have a mexicantheme snack list for wednesdays both nights are fun and delicious  the atmosphere is maybe the best part  for me green street has a cozy  intimate feeling while still having a chic feel the music is usually soul and funk  which i love  but there are other styles mixed in  the staff is friendly  and good at their jobs  if youre having a hard time finding the place  youre not alone it looks sketchy from the outside  but is amazing on the inside the best advise i have is to look at the pictures on yelp if you take a look at them  youll have a much easier time finding it,positive
i wont go here again the service was very slow and some of our food came cold  i had the shrimp from the appetizer menu and didnt feel good the rest of the night  this is definitely a miss,negative
i stopped at this place because they had a sign out front that said free free free  can of soda and a bag of chips with sandwich or platter purchase  ok  it got me  so i went in  ordered a sandwich  grabbed a small bag of chips off the shelf and a can of soda and went to the register  to my surprise  it rung up at 11  when i questioned the man he said the chips i had didnt count  i needed the secret crappy chips they had hidden behind the counter  ok  so then my total was still 880  oh  only the chips or the soda is included  not both  and btw  it clearly says and a bag of chips see photos  so i gave the chips back and said i just wanted the soda so he mumbled a new price i couldnt really hear and ran my card  i had to ask for the receipt and just shoved it in my pocket  so i get home and realize the receipt is for 880  really  shouldve taken those stupid chips  what a ripoff  and i check the reviews to find out that ripping people off is a normal business practice of theirs  only those reviews are conveniently filtered  did you know if you scroll down the bottom where it says 1 through x of x that there is a link to see reviews that have been filtered out  if you didnt you probably still dont  because i imagine my review will be filtered too  update i went back to the establishment to complain and they claimed the extra charge was not for the soda andor chips  but rather because i got my sandwich on a roll  like the other reviewer  the guy behind the counter offered it to me on a roll and i said fine i was never informed of the extra charge  but instead of apologizing for the confusion he offered to let me take the advertised bag of chips,negative
not sure what its like now  but was my favorite as an undergrad pizza was the best on campus salads were enormous   but honestly everyone should try to avoid it because they still dont use normal plats and silverware everything is disposable and for a school that takes a lot of pride in its greenness  thats pretty ridiculous,negative
wings etc recently opened up down the road from where i live  which made me excited to have a sports bar where i could catch a game with some hopefully tasty food and cold beer its a chain regional to the midwest and seems to have somewhat of a following  so what the heck  i went with coworkers on two occasions one  which i will briefly touch on  was to conquer their wall of flame challenge which involved eating 16 crazy hot wings with no food or drink success at the sacrifice of all taste for the next day worth it well  i did get a free tshirt  back to wings having worked in restaurants for a decent part of my life  i am critical when it comes to service  im not a jerk by any means  and i understand the concept of being busy  but there should be a good line of communication between staff and customer wings etc does not have this we waited 10 minutes for our waitress  15 minutes for our drinks  30 minutes for our food  and then 20 minutes more for her to bring us the check and then run our credit cards thats just not acceptable and the second time i went back  the service was just as bad not friendly  and way too long  as for the food  its ok the boneless wings are cooked to death so you get crusty nuggets and the traditional wings are a bit big because they are jumbo and have a large skin pocket on them that does not cook very well  leaving you with a flabby  fatty wing to eat the sauces are ok  much thicker than any other wing place i have been to  and most seem to have a tomato base so the sauce does not really stick to the wing  meaning the wings are a bit bland the fries they make are very tasty  but thats pretty much all i found enjoyable about the experience so sadly i will have to travel further down the road if i want chicken wings or a football game  because this place is just not working out,negative
bluefin bistro looks nice on the inside it has a great decor  that is the only good thing about this restaurant  i used to work in downtown lafayette  and one day the office decided to try it out  derailing ourselves from the most sacred taco tuesday at chumleys it took us about 30 minutes to be acknowledged for drinks by a ditzy waitress in a skintight uniform my water glass had a lipstick ring on it the cocktails are outrageously expensive for lafayette at lunchtime   upon ordering a lunch special  my seafood bisque came out with a giant piece of plastic in it it was obviously from the bag that the soup came in our ditzy waitress laughed it off  took my bowl  and never brought me another the sushi was marginal at best  my roll was falling apart  and the bento box seemed to have dried teriyaki sauce in it from another unfortunte victim of bluefin   when the meal was over  i was presented with a check for full price the manager was nowhere to be found to complain about the atrocious service and sanitary practices  or how many times our waitress said oooooops and laughed it off i will never go to bluefin again,negative
